Experience with modeling in Python: Jupyter, Pandas, PyTorch, numpy, scipy, etc. Exception to the above: Outstanding familiarity with blockchains and protocols and their often quirky data, along with extensive experience in environments like Dune or Flipside, can compensate for a lack of more traditional data science experience. If you’re the #3 person on the Dune leaderboard, let’s talk. Be smart and get shit done. Be a doer and a risk-taker. Nice to haves (this is an OR)Experience with advertising technology or campaign management within Web 2 adsExperience with A/B testing and experimentationExperience in anti-fraud, either within ad tech or fin tech. There are lots of bad guys to block in Web 3. LocationYou can be located anywhere in the world, but we have a strong preference for SF or NYC. If you’re not in either city, expect some travel to work face-to-face with colleagues on a semi-regular basis. If you’re in one of those cities, you’ll find a balance between coming into the office and not. We think in-person work possesses a magic for early stage startups, something unobtainable in a fully remote environment where co-workers are simply images on a screen.

You will be creating the metrics and methodologies that will define an entire industry within Web 3. There won’t be easy answers for most of what we do. We’re already making it up as we go along.Speed is a feature, in teams, products, and people: keep up with the Spindl pack. There isn’t a moment to lose.We’re looking for pirates now that Web 2 has become the navy.ResponsibilitiesBe a leader within a very flat and fast-moving teamUnderstand the often weird and hacked-together blockchain world, as well as the embryonic data stack being built on top of itNavigate the idea maze toward Truth (or something like it)Plot the critical curve or generate the essential dashboard that helps us understand Web 3. Creatively address business problems when there are no precedents and no clear answersWork with engineering to implement your findings and models into running product quickly. You are mapping the unknown terrain; we want to turn that into industry knowledge ASAP. Empathize with our customers, understand their worldview, and work with the UI team to translate your insights into customer insights. Convey your findings to colleagues; tell a story with data convincingly. Optionally, publish your work publicly will full credit. Must haves (this is an AND)N years doing data science or analysis (for reasonable N). Proficiency with data visualization and dashboarding tools like Looker or Tableau. Think those suck? Tell us why. Ideally, this would involve more than just descriptive dashboarding and extend into some predictive model-building around complicated ecosystems like markets or user behavior online. Experience with modeling in Python: Jupyter, Pandas, PyTorch, numpy, scipy, etc. Exception to the above: Outstanding familiarity with blockchains and protocols and their often quirky data, along with extensive experience in environments like Dune or Flipside, can compensate for a lack of more traditional data science experience. If you’re the #3 person on the Dune leaderboard, let’s talk. Be smart and get shit done. Be a doer and a risk-taker. Nice to haves (this is an OR)Experience with advertising technology or campaign management within Web 2 adsExperience with A/B testing and experimentationExperience in anti-fraud, either within ad tech or fin tech. There are lots of bad guys to block in Web 3. LocationYou can be located anywhere in the world, but we have a strong preference for SF or NYC. If you’re not in either city, expect some travel to work face-to-face with colleagues on a semi-regular basis. If you’re in one of those cities, you’ll find a balance between coming into the office and not. We think in-person work possesses a magic for early stage startups, something unobtainable in a fully remote environment where co-workers are simply images on a screen.

Spindl,Data Scientist,"You’ll be the founding data scientist in a well-funded company looking to define Web 3 user identity and attribution.We plan on running a lean team: expect to totally own your area of responsibility and use your initiative and judgement to keep your part of Spindl running and growing.Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. You will be creating the metrics and methodologies that will define an entire industry within Web 3. There won’t be easy answers for most of what we do. We’re already making it up as we go along.Speed is a feature, in teams, products, and people: keep up with the Spindl pack. There isn’t a moment to lose.We’re looking for pirates now that Web 2 has become the navy.ResponsibilitiesBe a leader within a very flat and fast-moving teamUnderstand the often weird and hacked-together blockchain world, as well as the embryonic data stack being built on top of itNavigate the idea maze toward Truth (or something like it)Plot the critical curve or generate the essential dashboard that helps us understand Web 3. Creatively address business problems when there are no precedents and no clear answersWork with engineering to implement your findings and models into running product quickly. You are mapping the unknown terrain; we want to turn that into industry knowledge ASAP. Empathize with our customers, understand their worldview, and work with the UI team to translate your insights into customer insights. Convey your findings to colleagues; tell a story with data convincingly. Optionally, publish your work publicly will full credit. Must haves (this is an AND)N years doing data science or analysis (for reasonable N). Proficiency with data visualization and dashboarding tools like Looker or Tableau. Think those suck? Tell us why. Ideally, this would involve more than just descriptive dashboarding and extend into some predictive model-building around complicated ecosystems like markets or user behavior online. Experience with modeling in Python: Jupyter, Pandas, PyTorch, numpy, scipy, etc. Exception to the above: Outstanding familiarity with blockchains and protocols and their often quirky data, along with extensive experience in environments like Dune or Flipside, can compensate for a lack of more traditional data science experience. If you’re the #3 person on the Dune leaderboard, let’s talk. Be smart and get shit done. Be a doer and a risk-taker. Nice to haves (this is an OR)Experience with advertising technology or campaign management within Web 2 adsExperience with A/B testing and experimentationExperience in anti-fraud, either within ad tech or fin tech. There are lots of bad guys to block in Web 3. LocationYou can be located anywhere in the world, but we have a strong preference for SF or NYC. If you’re not in either city, expect some travel to work face-to-face with colleagues on a semi-regular basis. If you’re in one of those cities, you’ll find a balance between coming into the office and not. We think in-person work possesses a magic for early stage startups, something unobtainable in a fully remote environment where co-workers are simply images on a screen.

Spindl,Data Scientist,"You’ll be the founding data scientist in a well-funded company looking to define Web 3 user identity and attribution.We plan on running a lean team: expect to totally own your area of responsibility and use your initiative and judgement to keep your part of Spindl running and growing.Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. You will be creating the metrics and methodologies that will define an entire industry within Web 3. There won’t be easy answers for most of what we do. We’re already making it up as we go along.Speed is a feature, in teams, products, and people: keep up with the Spindl pack. There isn’t a moment to lose.We’re looking for pirates now that Web 2 has become the navy.ResponsibilitiesBe a leader within a very flat and fast-moving teamUnderstand the often weird and hacked-together blockchain world, as well as the embryonic data stack being built on top of itNavigate the idea maze toward Truth (or something like it)Plot the critical curve or generate the essential dashboard that helps us understand Web 3. Creatively address business problems when there are no precedents and no clear answersWork with engineering to implement your findings and models into running product quickly. You are mapping the unknown terrain; we want to turn that into industry knowledge ASAP. Empathize with our customers, understand their worldview, and work with the UI team to translate your insights into customer insights. Convey your findings to colleagues; tell a story with data convincingly. Optionally, publish your work publicly will full credit. Must haves (this is an AND)N years doing data science or analysis (for reasonable N). Proficiency with data visualization and dashboarding tools like Looker or Tableau. Think those suck? Tell us why. Ideally, this would involve more than just descriptive dashboarding and extend into some predictive model-building around complicated ecosystems like markets or user behavior online. Experience with modeling in Python: Jupyter, Pandas, PyTorch, numpy, scipy, etc. Exception to the above: Outstanding familiarity with blockchains and protocols and their often quirky data, along with extensive experience in environments like Dune or Flipside, can compensate for a lack of more traditional data science experience. If you’re the #3 person on the Dune leaderboard, let’s talk. Be smart and get shit done. Be a doer and a risk-taker. Nice to haves (this is an OR)Experience with advertising technology or campaign management within Web 2 adsExperience with A/B testing and experimentationExperience in anti-fraud, either within ad tech or fin tech. There are lots of bad guys to block in Web 3. LocationYou can be located anywhere in the world, but we have a strong preference for SF or NYC. If you’re not in either city, expect some travel to work face-to-face with colleagues on a semi-regular basis. If you’re in one of those cities, you’ll find a balance between coming into the office and not. We think in-person work possesses a magic for early stage startups, something unobtainable in a fully remote environment where co-workers are simply images on a screen.

You will be creating the metrics and methodologies that will define an entire industry within Web 3. There won’t be easy answers for most of what we do. We’re already making it up as we go along.Speed is a feature, in teams, products, and people: keep up with the Spindl pack.

Creatively address business problems when there are no precedents and no clear answersWork with engineering to implement your findings and models into running product quickly. You are mapping the unknown terrain; we want to turn that into industry knowledge ASAP. Empathize with our customers, understand their worldview, and work with the UI team to translate your insights into customer insights. Convey your findings to colleagues; tell a story with data convincingly. Optionally, publish your work publicly will full credit. Must haves (this is an AND)N years doing data science or analysis (for reasonable N). Proficiency with data visualization and dashboarding tools like Looker or Tableau. Think those suck? Tell us why. Ideally, this would involve more than just descriptive dashboarding and extend into some predictive model-building around complicated ecosystems like markets or user behavior online. Experience with modeling in Python: Jupyter, Pandas, PyTorch, numpy, scipy, etc. Exception to the above: Outstanding familiarity with blockchains and protocols and their often quirky data, along with extensive experience in environments like Dune or Flipside, can compensate for a lack of more traditional data science experience. If you’re the #3 person on the Dune leaderboard, let’s talk. Be smart and get shit done. Be a doer and a risk-taker.

If you’re not in either city, expect some travel to work face-to-face with colleagues on a semi-regular basis. If you’re in one of those cities, you’ll find a balance between coming into the office and not. We think in-person work possesses a magic for early stage startups, something unobtainable in a fully remote environment where co-workers are simply images on a screen.

Spindl,Data Scientist,"You’ll be the founding data scientist in a well-funded company looking to define Web 3 user identity and attribution.We plan on running a lean team: expect to totally own your area of responsibility and use your initiative and judgement to keep your part of Spindl running and growing.Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. You will be creating the metrics and methodologies that will define an entire industry within Web 3. There won’t be easy answers for most of what we do. We’re already making it up as we go along.Speed is a feature, in teams, products, and people: keep up with the Spindl pack. There isn’t a moment to lose.We’re looking for pirates now that Web 2 has become the navy.ResponsibilitiesBe a leader within a very flat and fast-moving teamUnderstand the often weird and hacked-together blockchain world, as well as the embryonic data stack being built on top of itNavigate the idea maze toward Truth (or something like it)Plot the critical curve or generate the essential dashboard that helps us understand Web 3. Creatively address business problems when there are no precedents and no clear answersWork with engineering to implement your findings and models into running product quickly. You are mapping the unknown terrain; we want to turn that into industry knowledge ASAP. Empathize with our customers, understand their worldview, and work with the UI team to translate your insights into customer insights. Convey your findings to colleagues; tell a story with data convincingly. Optionally, publish your work publicly will full credit. Must haves (this is an AND)N years doing data science or analysis (for reasonable N). Proficiency with data visualization and dashboarding tools like Looker or Tableau. Think those suck? Tell us why. Ideally, this would involve more than just descriptive dashboarding and extend into some predictive model-building around complicated ecosystems like markets or user behavior online. Experience with modeling in Python: Jupyter, Pandas, PyTorch, numpy, scipy, etc. Exception to the above: Outstanding familiarity with blockchains and protocols and their often quirky data, along with extensive experience in environments like Dune or Flipside, can compensate for a lack of more traditional data science experience. If you’re the #3 person on the Dune leaderboard, let’s talk. Be smart and get shit done. Be a doer and a risk-taker. Nice to haves (this is an OR)Experience with advertising technology or campaign management within Web 2 adsExperience with A/B testing and experimentationExperience in anti-fraud, either within ad tech or fin tech. There are lots of bad guys to block in Web 3. LocationYou can be located anywhere in the world, but we have a strong preference for SF or NYC. If you’re not in either city, expect some travel to work face-to-face with colleagues on a semi-regular basis. If you’re in one of those cities, you’ll find a balance between coming into the office and not. We think in-person work possesses a magic for early stage startups, something unobtainable in a fully remote environment where co-workers are simply images on a screen.
